# Utilities and Data Science (Codecademy Practice)

## The cost of living (for utilities, at least) in Central California over the span of 3 years (2018-2021)

This is data I've been tracking since moving into my current home, as I was in charge with compiling all expenses for our utilities each month. It's pretty barebones, but is a great start in practicing and refining my data science skillset. I will only be using data for full years, so early months of 2022 will not be included in the data manipulation (but will remain in csv).

### I will be figuring out what to do with this data as I go. I'll also be starting with 'easier' methods before tackling dataframes, series', and other advanced methods.
